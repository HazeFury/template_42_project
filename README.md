## II. Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before using this template, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv 0.10.12+**

### Quick Start
To set up the environment and run the project for the first time, simply use the following command in your terminal:

	make run

### Makefile Commands Reference
This project is fully automated using Make. Here is the complete list of available commands to manage the project lifecycle:

**Installation & Setup**
- ```make install``` (or **make all**): Initializes the virtual environment (.venv) and synchronizes all dependencies using uv.
- ```make setup```: Checks your Python version and installs the uv package manager if it is not already installed.

**Execution & Debugging**
- ```make run```: Executes the main entry point (src/main.py) inside the isolated virtual environment.
- ```make debug```: Launches the project using the Python Debugger (pdb), allowing you to step through your code line by line.

**Quality & Testing**
- ```make lint```: Runs flake8 for style checking and mypy for static type checking to ensure code quality.
- ```make lint-strict```: Runs the linters but enforces strict typing rules with mypy.
- ```make test```: Runs the entire test suite using pytest.
- ```make test-file FILE=path/to/test.py```: Runs a specific test file. Replace the FILE variable with your target.

**Building & Cleaning**
- ```make build```: Packages the project into distributable files inside a dist/ directory.
- ```make clean```: Removes all temporary files, such as __pycache__ folders and linter caches.
- ```make fclean```: Performs a deep clean. It executes the clean rule and also removes the virtual environment and build files.
- ```make re```: Rebuilds the project from scratch by running fclean followed by all.
